CONGRATS!!!!!!!  
You have configured a project and created two Compute Engine instances. 
1. server - running mongodb
2. client - running small go app with api 

The client should be accessible at the url preceeding this message, 
*in a few moments*. If it is not up, try waiting 3 minutes before trying again. 
 
In the meantime you can inspect these vms in the Cloud Console -
